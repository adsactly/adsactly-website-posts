ADSactly on ADSactly (Part #2)

Members of the ADSactly society come from different backgrounds and possess a wide array of various skill-sets. Nonetheless, we are all independent and open-minded individuals who share common goals. As a group, we possess a wide spectrum of knowledge and talents that help us become unique and successful in what we do. Every individual possesses skills, time, energy, resources, and a network of influence. ADSactly members invest those assets in projects of their own choice.

The administration, consisting of overseers, highly values cooperation between members from all communities within our society and strongly encourage it. There is no official delegation of work, unless for the needs of the society's organization and administration. The work on member's projects is delegated (between members) on the basis of doocracy(3) principles without the direct involvement of the administration.

(3) Definition of Doocracy (do-ocracy)
<blockquote>"A doocracy is an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them. Responsibilities are attached to people who do the work, rather than elected or selected officials."</blockquote>
This vast potential of human resources and individual assets is one of the cherished aspects of the ADSactly society. Fully utilizing available skill-sets greatly helps in overcoming all work-related challenges. Working in teams, sharing ideas and eagerly participating in mutual projects is what makes us proud members of our society. Our collective sense of work is driven by passion. The passion is what pushes forward the entire society. General value network(4) principles are strongly embedded in the ADSactly society's labour distribution system.

(4) Definition of Value Network
<blockquote>"Value network is a complex set of social and technical resources that work together via relationships to create value in the form of knowledge, intelligence, products, services or social good. Included in a company’s value networks are research, development, design, production, marketing, sales, and distribution - working interdependently to add to the overall worth of products and services. Companies also have external facing value networks where a value is created from the relationships and interactions between organizations, its customers or recipients, intermediaries, stakeholders, complementors and suppliers. Value network principles apply equally well to public agencies, civil society organizations and other purposeful networks focused on creating economic or social good."</blockquote>
Every honest individual with good intentions is invited to join and offer skills, knowledge, energy, time or resources to various ongoing projects within ADSactly society.
