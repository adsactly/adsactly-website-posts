ADSactly on ADSACTLY - Part #3

ADSactly members are encouraged to associate and freely organize themselves according to the needs of various projects. Each member is welcome to introduce himself, his human values, and pursue intended goals on the road to success. Anyone with strong work-ethics, firm morals and goodwill is welcome to contribute according to his own abilities and affinities. ADSactly is a place to meet and organize in achieving goals. It is important to mention that many members of our community are involved in ground-breaking block-chain projects.

ADSactly is not a company, a corporation, an investment fund, a business association, nor any other form of financial or business-like institution. We are a free, open-value society with mutual funds, mutual projects and our own crypto-currencies. No one is coerced into anything. On the contrary, we encourage personal responsibility for one's actions. A business-like association may freely be formed within ADSactly but only as a project organized by a group of members within a society, and it is not to be regarded as the ADSactly society's project.

Everything in existence needs some level of organization so that things work as conceived and the original vision is kept or re-directed if needed. The guidelines for the administrative work, oriented toward the building of the society and its organization, are decided by the Board of Overseers. The Board of Overseers, the ADSactly administration, consisting of people who have pledged to use their knowledge, expertise and skills for the betterment of the society, builds and directs the society's development according to the premises of open stewardship(5).

(5) Definition of Open Stewardship
<blockquote>Stewardship, as an ethic, implies taking responsibility for and managing a collective resource. Open Stewardship is a way of thinking, acting, and being that invites and facilitates the ongoing care and co-creation of shared resources within the complex, fluid environments. These shared resources can be understood in the narrow sense of code, concepts, or designs. Shared resources can be understood in a broader sense to include our environments — both our online environments, and the places we live (our cities, towns, villages) Finally, our shared resources include our collective social contexts – our groups, organizations, institutions, and networks. Open Stewardship invites and facilitates the care and development of these resources in the context of ever-expanding networks of projects and concerns.</blockquote>
Every honest individual with good intentions is invited to join and offer skills, knowledge, energy, time or resources to various ongoing projects within ADSactly society.
