ADSactly on ADSACTLY - Part #5

“Why does ADSactly society exits?” is the second question demanding answers.
ADSactly exists because of your time.

A funny answer, right? Let us explain this in more detail.

We are unhappy with the unfair distribution of financial means in the economic systems around the globe and the ill direction of affairs to which it leads. The simplified core of the problem lies in the fact that many people who do the actual work get the least money for their time, while non-producers, especially owners of non-producing organizations like banking institutions, trading institutions, various organizations and all other centralized structures, profit the most for very little or no time invested. The only tangible resource any person has is - time. The non-producers get too good of a deal, while the real producers end up on the opposite part of the scale.

The pyramid reveals that half of the world's wealth belongs to the top 1%.

A very important aspect of your life that shouldn't be overlooked is your work or "your time". It is your investment asset, you are the one in charge of it, meaning you and only you are to decide what you want to do with it. We, as a society of individuals, are here to help, if you understand and apply the simple concepts outlined in this and previous posts of the "ADSactly on ADSACTLY" blog series.

ADSactly doesn't employ people because we are not a business association. You may decide to join and invest your time, tangible and intangible resources if so you desire. Some of us started their projects and got help from other members of the society, some of us decided to join on bigger projects run by other members, some of us decided to join and qualified to serve in the administration, while some of us are avid crypto-currency traders. What we all have in common is that we decided to invest our time and our knowledge. Never forget that a lot of effort comes before any rewards. This is how things are.

ADSactly society was established to give equal opportunities for work and prosperity to everyone who wants to invest his/her time, knowledge, energy, skills and resources. However, the accent is on: “people who do the work”.

So, ADSactly is here because of your time. We want you to receive fair offers for your time. Meaning, we are here for YOU!

Every honest individual with good intentions is invited to join and offer skills, knowledge, energy, time or resources to various ongoing projects within ADSactly society. The channel is here: <a title="This link will take you away from steemit.com" href="https://discord.gg/7mqmx2M" rel="noopener">ADSactly</a> and you are welcome.
