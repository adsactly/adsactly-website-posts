<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Socio-economic decentralization does not diminish or dissipate economic potential. Localization removes regional disparity because wealth is distributed almost equally everywhere.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Today’s banking is dominated by all-devouring colossuses that crave to be fed by public money, whenever their speculation fails spectacularly, to continue their existence as masters of global trade. In contrast, ADSactly decentralized banking system presents a rational approach to supplying money when and where it is required for human welfare.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Some people Countries are Against General Welfare for their people. This is not a Communist Approach of any kind this has already been implemented in places like Finland for example.(</span>[/vc_column_text][cz_service_box icon="fa fa-chevron-right" title="2015" id="cz_16436" cz_service_box=""]

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;"> At the beginning of civilization, the desire to create arts and crafts arose in the human mind. At that time artisans used to work at home, and arts and crafts were produced in cottage industries. Men, women, boys and girls – all participated in the creation of arts and crafts. Later people realized that some arts and crafts could not be produced in every village, so certain artifacts were produced by a few combined villages. If artisans had not combined together, they would have suffered losses in the marketplace, and their numbers would have been significantly reduced. So gradually human beings started to go and work in places where production was done collectively, or the first factories. At that time the few industries that existed were decentralized.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">In this connection one thing should be remembered – the more that arts and crafts are decentralized, the greater the benefits for human society.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Decentralization does not diminish or dissipate economic potential.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Rather, decentralization removes regional disparity because wealth is distributed almost equally everywhere.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">We do not find situations where people in some places cry out in agony due to scarcity and starvation, while people in other places become immoral due to excessive affluence and over abundance. In fact, industrial centralization is detrimental to a well-knit social order.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">In a decentralized economy people do not have to leave their homes to work in an industry, and consequently they are saved from the expenditure of maintaining two establishments. Moreover, decentralization increases the possibility of saving labor, because people can earn their livelihood while simultaneously taking care of their household responsibilities.(edited)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">This arrangement is not possible under capitalism. Capitalism will never support decentralization, because capitalist production exists to maximize profits. Centralization means industry for profit, while decentralization means industry for consumption. ADSactly’s approach, which will be supported by all rational people, is production for consumption. ADSactly's maxim is, “Production for consumption, not production for profiteering.”(edited)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Capitalists want to produce commodities at the lowest costs and sell them at the highest prices. To produce commodities cheaply, there must be efficient transportation, cheap raw materials, cheap labour, cheap energy, adequate water supply, etc. No matter what form capitalism takes – individual capitalism, group capitalism or state capitalism – capitalists will always prefer centralized production. All these forms of capitalism are essentially the same.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">Communism is state capitalism which is why it is not free from the defects of capitalism. State capitalists, like individual and group capitalists, control industries. State capitalism means state controlled industries. In other words, in state capitalism industries are centralized. Communist countries support state capitalism, which means centralized production. While communism appears to differ from capitalism on the question of popular liberation, capitalism and communism are the same internally. Fruits of the same variety may have different colour skins, but their seeds are the same. Capitalism and communism are fruits of the same variety.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px;">To ensure the social and economic liberation of human beings, the maximum amount of socio-economic decentralization is essential. While it may be difficult to establish village-level economic infrastructure at present, there is no insurmountable obstacle preventing us from establishing block-level economic infrastructure. As far as possible, the establishment, operation and distribution of all industries should be done at block level. Only when this cannot be done should industries be organized at a higher level. Obviously, industries such as iron and steel factories cannot function in every village, block and district, so they should function in a larger area.</span>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
